# VENDING-MACHINE
Designed and implemented a digital electronics-based vending machine using logic gates and a 7-segment display. The system processes user inputs, simulates product selection, and displays the output. Built on a breadboard and simulated in Proteus, it demonstrates digital logic and hardware integration.
